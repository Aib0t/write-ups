## INTRO

Back in a day, when internet was still young a lot of very serious people in suits were trying their best to apply real-world business practice of old to the new field of the internet. One of such thing was ads. While ads in web and mobile ads are now a staple of the web as a whole, ads in videogames in form of in-game objects are rather uncommon. The most recent example I can recal myself is ads in Battlefield 2042, but that's it.

But in 2000s there were a lot of attempts to capture the market and create another flow of the revenue for developers and publishers. There were many, but Massive Incorporated was probably the most notable one, present in AAA titles of that era.

And so me, being a researcher of silly network things in videogames, couldn't pass the opportunity to take a look into it.

## HISTORY

Massive Incorporated was created in 2002 as a `advertising company that provided software and services to dynamically host advertisements within video games`. It's rather hard to track down the very first title, but according to [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20220817143603/https://www.gamesindustry.biz/massive-incorporated-unleashes-next-gen-version-of-its-in-game-advertising-technology) article at the end of 2005 they were already on version 3 and boasting about "over 100 titles"

There also a portfolio from an ex worker, who was kind enough to include a lot of games with it https://madestream.com/portfolio_v3/project.php?pid=309&name=Massive+Incorporated+Game+Ads . Thanks, David Or!

## Known Versions

At this point in time, thanks to website "dlldownloader" and a lot of games I was able to get in my possession 4 out of 5 known versions of the MAD:

- `m4d.dll` with version 1.2 of MAD
- `MassiveAdClient.dll` with version 2.4
- Need For Speed: Carbon 1.4 with versions 3.2
- Sk8te 2 for Xbox 360 (with debug symbols!) with version >3.2

I've zero idea where first 2 dlls are coming from, and I'm not sure any interesting games utilizing it. So I focused on version 3.5, while utilizing Sk8te 2 symbols to aid me in reversing stuff. Plus from version 4 they switched to https, with ciphers which are now not supported by pretty much anything modern. So I decided to tackle version 3 first, and then work with version 4.

## First packet

On load, NFSC sends a http request to `http://locate.madserver.net/advsrc/locateService`.

If we check the content of data being sent:

```
POST /adsrv/locateService HTTP/1.1
Host:127.0.0.1
Content-Length:31
Content-Type:application/massive
User-Agent:Adclient Massive Inc./3.2.1.55

Ã‰=nfs_carbon_pc_na>0.0
```

This payload looks a little bit off. Let's check raw bytes.

```
03c9000000193d0010
6e66735f636172626f6e5f70635f6e61 - nfs_carbon_pc_na
3e0003
302e30 - 0.0
```

Okay. Now things are getting interesting. This is a raw bytes buffer! Curious approach by Massive.

After some snooping around in Sk8te 2 I was able to track down the function responsible for constructing said buffer:

```C++
void WriteLocateServiceRequest@CRequestLocateService@MassiveAdClient3
               (int param_1,undefined8 param_2,undefined8 param_3)

{
  undefined8 uVar1;
  size_t sVar2;
  char *local_30 [12];
  
                    /* Writing Request... */
  ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
            (5,*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0xc),0xffffffff8236faec);
  ?WriteU8@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAXEH@Z(param_1,0x3d,0);
  ?WriteString@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAXPADH@Z(param_1,param_2,0);
                    /* Writing SKU Name: %s */
  ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
            (5,*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0xc),0xffffffff8236fbdc,param_2);
  ?WriteU8@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAXEH@Z(param_1,0x3e,0);
  ?WriteString@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAXPADH@Z(param_1,param_3,0);
                    /* Writing SKU Version: %s */
  ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
            (5,*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0xc),0xffffffff8236fbc4,param_3);
  local_30[0] = (char *)0x0;
  uVar1 = ?Instance@CMassiveSystem@MassiveAdClient3@@SAPAV12@XZ();
  ?GetHardwareAddress@CMassiveSystem@MassiveAdClient3@@QAAXPAPAD@Z(uVar1,local_30);
  if (local_30[0] != (char *)0x0) {
    sVar2 = strlen(local_30[0]);
    if (sVar2 != 0) {
      uVar1 = CalculateMD5Hash(local_30[0]);
      ?WriteU8@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAXEH@Z(param_1,0x1d,0);
      ?WriteString@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAXPADH@Z(param_1,uVar1,0);
                    /* Writing Hashed Hardware ID: %s */
      ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
                (5,*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0xc),0xffffffff8236fba4,uVar1);
      (*(code *)PTR_free_84494774)(local_30[0]);
      goto LAB_834b1648;
    }
  }
                    /* Could not get Hardware ID from system. */
  ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
            (2,*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0xc),0xffffffff8236fb7c);
LAB_834b1648:
  ?FinishBaseBlock@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAXEHH@Z(param_1,0xc9,0,0);
  return;
}
```

And things become crystal clear! Thanks symbols, you're trully a biggest gift to humanity.

Using the function above we're able to fully understand the payload:

```
03 - unknown
c9000000 - task id (Locate service)
19 - payload size
3d00 - field id (SKU name)
10 - string size
6e66735f636172626f6e5f70635f6e61 - SKU name (nfs_carbon_pc_na)
3e00 - field id (SKU version)
03 - string size
302e30 - SKU version (0.0)
```

Great, now we can implement some sort of a parsing. For server I decided to use my beloved `actix-web` web server framework and bytes reader via `scroll`.

```rust
async fn locate_service_v3(
    mut req: HttpRequest,
    mut body: web::Payload,
) -> actix_web::Result<String> {
    let mut bytes: BytesMut = web::BytesMut::new();
    while let Some(item) = body.next().await {
        bytes.extend_from_slice(&item?);
    }
    let hex_string = hex::encode(bytes.clone());
    info!("payload: {hex_string}");

    let mut bytes_cur = Cursor::new(bytes.clone());

    let unk1: u8 = bytes_cur.ioread::<u8>().unwrap();
    let task_id: u32 = bytes_cur.ioread::<u32>().unwrap();

    let payload_size: u8 = bytes_cur.ioread::<u8>().unwrap();

    let sku_name_field: u16 = bytes_cur.ioread::<u16>().unwrap();

    let sku_name_size: u8 = bytes_cur.ioread::<u8>().unwrap();

    let mut sku_name_vec: Vec<u8> = Vec::with_capacity(sku_name_size.into());

    for i in 0..sku_name_size {
        let mut buf: [u8; 1] = [0; 1];
        bytes_cur.read(&mut buf);
        sku_name_vec.push(buf[0]);
    }

    let sku_name: String = String::from_utf8(sku_name_vec).unwrap();

    let sku_version_field: u16 = bytes_cur.ioread::<u16>().unwrap();

    let sku_version_size: u8 = bytes_cur.ioread::<u8>().unwrap();
    let mut sku_version_vec: Vec<u8> = Vec::with_capacity(sku_version_size.into());

    for i in 0..sku_version_size {
        let mut buf: [u8; 1] = [0; 1];
        bytes_cur.read(&mut buf);
        sku_version_vec.push(buf[0]);
    }

    let sku_version: String = String::from_utf8(sku_version_vec).unwrap();

    info!("Task id: {task_id} | payload_size: {payload_size} | sku_name: {sku_name} | sku_version: {sku_version}");

    Ok(format!("Request Body Bytes:\n{:?}", bytes))
}
```

Quick and dirty, but it gets the job done.

```

```

Now it's time to figure out the reply for this request.

## Reply to LocateService request

Just below `WriteLocateServiceRequest` I found `Parse@CRequestLocateService@MassiveAdClient3` and it's a rather long function.

% SCREENSHOT HERE %

If we look though the function flow, it's rather simple.

- Check first byte for version value (3 in our case with NFS:Carbon)
- Check reply task id to be equal `0xCA`
- Read u32 of packet size
- Parse fields with values of `0x48`, `0x22`, `0x2d`, `0x49`, `0x4A`, `0x4B`, `0x3A`, `0x3B`, `0x0D` and `0x54`
- Return from the function

Not all values are mandatory, and since we have names for all of them from Sk8te 2 symbols we can construct this enum

```rust
#[repr(u8)]
pub enum LocationResponseMADFields {
    ZoneServerUrl=0x48,
    ZoneServerPort=0x49,
    MediaServerUrl=0x2d,
    MediaServerPort=0x4a,
    ImpressionsServerUrl=0x22,
    ImpressionsServerPort=0x4b,
    HeartBeatPeriod=0x54,
    ServerConfigurableOptions=0x3a,
    ReadingServerTime=0x3b

}
```

By checking logic in `ReadU8`, `ReadString` and others we can construct a rather simple reply writer of:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq, TryFromPrimitive, IntoPrimitive)]
#[repr(u8)]
pub enum MadServerProtocolVersion {
    Version1 = 0x01,
    Version2 = 0x02,
    Version3 = 0x03,
    Version4 = 0x04,
}

#[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq, TryFromPrimitive, IntoPrimitive)]
#[repr(u8)]
pub enum MadReplyTaskId {
    LocateService = 0xCA,
}

pub struct MADReply {
    version: MadServerProtocolVersion,
    task_id: MadReplyTaskId,
    buf: Vec<u8>,
}

impl MADReply {
    pub fn new(protocol_version: MadServerProtocolVersion, task_id: MadReplyTaskId) -> Self {
        MADReply {
            version: protocol_version,
            task_id: task_id,
            buf: Vec::new(),
        }
    }

    pub fn add_string<E: Into<u8>>(&mut self, field: E, value: &str) {
        let data = value.as_bytes();
        self.buf.push(field.into());
        self.buf
            .write_u16::<LittleEndian>(data.len() as u16)
            .unwrap();
        self.buf.extend_from_slice(data);
    }

    pub fn add_u8<E: Into<u8>>(&mut self, field: E, value: u8) {
        self.buf.push(field.into());
        self.buf.write_u8(value).unwrap();
    }

    pub fn add_u16<E: Into<u8>>(&mut self, field: E, value: u16) {
        self.buf.push(field.into());
        self.buf.write_u16::<LittleEndian>(value).unwrap();
    }

    pub fn add_u32(&mut self, field: LocationResponseMADFields, value: u32) {
        self.buf.push(field as u8);
        self.buf.write_u32::<LittleEndian>(value).unwrap();
    }

    pub fn add_u64(&mut self, field: LocationResponseMADFields, value: u64) {
        self.buf.push(field as u8);
        self.buf.write_u64::<LittleEndian>(value).unwrap();
    }

    pub fn into_bytes(self) -> Vec<u8> {
        self.buf
    }

    pub fn build_reply(self) -> Vec<u8> {

        let mut final_buf: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
        final_buf.push(self.version.into());
        final_buf.push(self.task_id.into());
        final_buf.write_u32::<LittleEndian>(self.buf.len() as u32);
        final_buf.extend_from_slice(&self.buf);

        final_buf
    }
}
```

Which we utilize as

```rust
    let mut reply = MADReply::new(
        MadServerProtocolVersion::Version3,
        MadReplyTaskId::LocateService,
    );

    reply.add_string(LocationResponseMADFields::ZoneServerUrl, "http://127.0.0.1");
    reply.add_u16(LocationResponseMADFields::ZoneServerPort, 80);
    reply.add_string(
        LocationResponseMADFields::MediaServerUrl,
        "http://127.0.0.1",
    );
    reply.add_u16(LocationResponseMADFields::MediaServerPort, 80);
    reply.add_string(
        LocationResponseMADFields::ImpressionsServerUrl,
        "http://127.0.0.1",
    );
    reply.add_u16(LocationResponseMADFields::ImpressionsServerPort, 80);
    reply.add_u32(LocationResponseMADFields::HeartBeatPeriod, 60);
    reply.add_u64(
        LocationResponseMADFields::ReadingServerTime,
        SystemTime::now()
            .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)
            .unwrap()
            .as_secs(),
    );

    let bytes = reply.build_reply();


    HttpResponse::Ok()
    .content_type("application/massive")
    .body(bytes)
```

We launch the game, see the request, send the reply and then...

**Nothing**

Okay, time to set a breakpoint in the function in NFS:Carbon and see where we fail exactly.

And we find out that function to parse the reply is not being called.

## Figuring out what are we missing

After some snooping in the binary we find the function which looks like a http reply header parser at `FUN_00873504`

```C++
undefined4 __fastcall FUN_00873504(int param_1)

{
  char *pcVar1;
  char *pcVar2;
  int iVar3;
  undefined4 *puVar4;
  undefined local_108;
  undefined4 local_107;
  int local_8;
  
  if (*(int *)(param_1 + 0x30) == 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  if (*(char **)(param_1 + 0x20) == (char *)0x0) {
    return 0;
  }
  pcVar1 = strtok(*(char **)(param_1 + 0x20),&DAT_009e9b80);
  if (pcVar1 == (char *)0x0) {
    return 0;
  }
  local_8 = 0;
  local_108 = 0;
  puVar4 = &local_107;
  for (iVar3 = 0x3f; iVar3 != 0; iVar3 = iVar3 + -1) {
    *puVar4 = 0;
    puVar4 = puVar4 + 1;
  }
  *(undefined2 *)puVar4 = 0;
  *(undefined *)((int)puVar4 + 2) = 0;
  sscanf(pcVar1,s_%*s_%d_%256[_a-zA-Z0-9]_009fe964,&local_8,&local_108);
  if (local_8 == 200) {
    *(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 8) = 1;
    while (pcVar1 = strtok((char *)0x0,&DAT_009e9b80), pcVar1 != (char *)0x0) {
      pcVar2 = strstr(pcVar1,s_Content-Length:_009fe954);
      if (pcVar2 != (char *)0x0) {
        sscanf(pcVar1,s_%*s_%d_009fe94c,param_1 + 0x40);
      }
      pcVar1 = strstr(pcVar1,s_Transfer-Encoding:_chunked_009fe930);
      if (pcVar1 != (char *)0x0) {
        *(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0x34) = 1;
      }
    }
    return 1;
  }
  if (local_8 < 400) {
    if (local_8 < 500) goto LAB_0087361c;
  }
  else if (local_8 < 500) {
    *(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 8) = 1;
    do {
      pcVar1 = strtok((char *)0x0,&DAT_009e9b80);
    } while (pcVar1 != (char *)0x0);
    return 0;
  }
  if (local_8 < 600) {
    *(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 8) = 1;
    do {
      pcVar1 = strtok((char *)0x0,&DAT_009e9b80);
    } while (pcVar1 != (char *)0x0);
    return 0;
  }
LAB_0087361c:
  *(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 8) = 1;
  return 0;
}
```

Let's try to set breakpoint in it and check step by step where are we failing exactly. And after one long long run though all op codes we realize that issue is not a missing header, but that the MassiveAdClient lib expecte camel case headers, instead of default lowercased once.

With a simple fix of:

```rust
    let mut reply = HttpResponse::Ok().body(bytes);    
    reply.head_mut().set_camel_case_headers(true);
    reply
```

we're now hitting the reply parser!

Sadly, this didn't trigger the game to request more data, so, we're back to the debugger.

## Debugging parser issues

This one took a while to figure out, generally to my own stupidity. But it changed perception of the protocol for good, and will help tremendously moving forward.

To leave the loop with a value of 1 we need to have a flag of `if_all_required_variables_were_parsed` of 1

```C++
    if (message_size <= (uint)(param_1->field32_0x20 - iVar1)) {
      if (if_all_required_variables_were_parsed != '\x01') {
        return 0;
      }
      return 1;
    }
```

which is set here

```C++
          else if (field_id_2 == 0x3b) {
            server_time = ReadU64((u_long)param_1);
            if_all_required_variables_were_parsed = if_all_required_variables_were_parsed + '\x01';
            param_1->server_time = server_time;
          }
```

So, we could trigger a "good ending" with only sending a packet consisting of field `0x3b` and U64 following it. Which again, didn't work.

So I decided to take a step back (instead of setting breakpoint at the location of `message_size` check and check the content of `param_1->field32_0x20` like I should have done first thing) and take a broader look at the data.

### Going though what we have learned once more time just to be sure

The starting message which I mapped as

```
03 - unknown
c9000000 - task id (Locate service)
19 - payload size
3d00 - field id (SKU name)
10 - string size
6e66735f636172626f6e5f70635f6e61 - SKU name (nfs_carbon_pc_na)
3e00 - field id (SKU version)
03 - string size
302e30 - SKU version (0.0)
```

But if we ACTUALLY try to think a little bit more here about the payload as a whole we would notice some huge mistakes I made.

1) Why task id is u32 and payload size is 1 byte? It makes more sense to have task id of 1 byte and payload size of u32.

2) In the source code I provided the string is written as 

```C++
                    /* Writing SKU Name: %s */
  ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
            (5,*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0xc),0xffffffff8236fbdc,param_2);
  ?WriteU8@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAXEH@Z(param_1,0x3e,0);
  ?WriteString@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAXPADH@Z(param_1,param_3,0);
```

No U16 for id, but inside `WriteString` there is a `WriteU16`. 

And that was the moment where I realized that me, being so used to little endianness on PC, got very, very wrong. Integers were written in big endianness all along!

And if we look at the payload with our newly gained knowledge the **proper** format of the message is:

```
03 - protocol version
c9 - task id (Locate service)
00000019 - payload size
3d - field id (SKU name)
0010 - string size
6e66735f636172626f6e5f70635f6e61 - SKU name (nfs_carbon_pc_na)
3e - field id (SKU version)
0003 - string size
302e30 - SKU version (0.0)
```

And now that we know that, we can finally fix it.

```rust
    pub fn build_reply(self) -> Vec<u8> {

        let mut final_buf: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
        final_buf.push(self.version.into());
        final_buf.push(self.task_id.into());
        final_buf.write_u32::<LittleEndian>(self.buf.len() as u32); //<< riiight here
        final_buf.extend_from_slice(&self.buf);

        final_buf
    }
```

And by verifying that check I mentioned earlier 

```C++
if (message_size <= (uint)(param_1->field32_0x20 - iVar1))
```

I was able to confirm that data in memory was messed up, which failed the check, so we never hit the check for the flag. And just like that a small oversight at the very beginning lead me to 2 days of debugging of a *really* dumb issue.

So a simple fix of 

```rust
final_buf.write_u32::<BigEndian>(self.buf.len() as u32);
```

and

```rust
    pub fn add_string<E: Into<u8>>(&mut self, field: E, value: &str) {
        let data = value.as_bytes();
        self.buf.push(field.into());
        self.buf
            .write_u16::<BigEndian>(data.len() as u16) //<< Here
            .unwrap();
        self.buf.extend_from_slice(data);
    }
```

finally made it all work as it should. And now we have a new request!

## OpenSession request

We check new request payload and

![alt text](img/open_session.png)

Oh. It's gonna take a while. But we do have symbols!

![alt text](img/open_session_symbols.png)

As usual, using logging messages I reconstructed yet another enum of field ids:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq, TryFromPrimitive, IntoPrimitive)]
#[repr(u8)]
pub enum OpenSessionRequestMADFields {
    //OpenSession
    SKUName = 0x3d, //String
    SKUVersion=0x3e, //String
    SessionType=0x3c, //U8
    ThirdPartyID=0x41, //String
    ThirdPartyServiceName=0x42, //String
    MultiplayerGUID=0x1c, //String
    Token=0x44, //String
    HashedHardwareID=0x1d, //String
    AdClientVersion=0x16, //String
}
```

And in return it expects:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq, TryFromPrimitive, IntoPrimitive)]
#[repr(u8)]
pub enum OpenSessionResponseMADFields {
    //OpenSession
    HMACSignature = 0x1e, //ByteArray
    MassivePlayerID=0x2a, //U32
    MassiveSessionID=0x2b, //U32
    ZoneName=0x47, //String
}
```

> HMACSignature

Ah, so it's not gonna be easy.

> `VerifyHMACSignature@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3`

Yep.

## HMAC and signatures

We finally got a new fence to jump over - message signatures. Lucky for us, MassiveAdClient is using not something funny or home-made, but just SHA1 HMAC, at least judging by its name (but I have trust issues at this point):

**Parse@CRequestOpenSession@MassiveAdClient3**
```C++
...
      if (all_required_fields_are_present == '\x03') {
        ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
                  (5,uVar8,"Response contains all of the required fields.",uVar10,param_5,param_ 6,
                   param_7,uVar12);
        iVar6 = ?VerifyHMACSignature@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAHXZ(param_1);
        if (iVar6 != 0) {
          ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
                    (5,(char)*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0xc),"Response successfully read and parsed. "
                     ,uVar10,param_5,param_6,param_7,uVar12);
          return 1;
        }
      }
      else {
        ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
                  (2,uVar8,"Response does not contain all of the required fields.",uVar10,param_ 5,
                   param_6,param_7,uVar12);
      }
...
```

and inside of `VerifyHMACSignature` in Sk8te

```C++
bool ?VerifyHMACSignature@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAHXZ(int param_1)

{
  size_t sVar2;
  longlong lVar1;
  int iVar3;
  bool bVar4;
  undefined uVar5;
  undefined uVar6;
  undefined in_r7;
  undefined in_r8;
  undefined in_r9;
  undefined in_r10;
  
  sVar2 = strlen(&DAT_845e5370);
  uVar6 = (undefined)sVar2;
  lVar1 = ?CalculateSHA1HMac@@YAPBXPAEH0H@Z
                    (*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0x1c),*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0x24),
                     0xffffffff845e5370);
  if (lVar1 == 0) {
    ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
              (1,(char)*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0xc),
               "Could not allocate space to calculate actual signature.",uVar6,in_r7,in_r8,in_r9 ,
               in_r10);
    bVar4 = false;
  }
  else {
    iVar3 = memcmp(*(void **)(param_1 + 0x30),(void *)lVar1,0x14);
    bVar4 = iVar3 == 0;
    uVar5 = (undefined)*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0xc);
    if (bVar4) {
      ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
                (5,uVar5,"Message passed signature verification",uVar6,in_r7,in_r8,in_r9,in_r10) ;
    }
    else {
      ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
                (2,uVar5,"Message failed signature verification",uVar6,in_r7,in_r8,in_r9,in_r10) ;
    }
    (*(code *)PTR_free_84494774)(lVar1);
  }
  return bVar4;
}
```

After some cross-referencing with PC version I was finally able to track down `CalculateSHA1HMac` on PC:

```C++
void * __cdecl CalculateSHA1HMac(undefined *param_1,int param_2,undefined *param_3,size_t param_ 4)

{
  int iVar1;
  void *_Dst;
  byte local_108 [68];
  byte local_c4 [68];
  uint local_80 [26];
  undefined local_18 [20];
  
  if (0x40 < (int)param_4) {
    SHA1Reset(local_80);
    SHA1Input(local_80,param_3,param_4);
    SHA1Result(local_80,(int)local_18);
    param_3 = local_18;
    param_4 = 0x14;
  }
  memset(local_c4,0,0x41);
  memset(local_108,0,0x41);
  memcpy(local_c4,param_3,param_4);
  memcpy(local_108,param_3,param_4);
  iVar1 = 0;
  do {
    local_c4[iVar1] = local_c4[iVar1] ^ 0x36;
    local_108[iVar1] = local_108[iVar1] ^ 0x5c;
    iVar1 = iVar1 + 1;
  } while (iVar1 < 0x40);
  SHA1Reset(local_80);
  SHA1Input(local_80,local_c4,0x40);
  SHA1Input(local_80,param_1,param_2);
  SHA1Result(local_80,(int)local_18);
  SHA1Reset(local_80);
  SHA1Input(local_80,local_108,0x40);
  SHA1Input(local_80,local_18,0x14);
  SHA1Result(local_80,(int)local_18);
  _Dst = (void *)(*(code *)PTR_malloc_00a7b944)(0x14);
  if (_Dst != (void *)0x0) {
    memcpy(_Dst,local_18,0x14);
  }
  return _Dst;
}
```

Which looks like...a default HMAC-SHA1 stuff? 

SHA1 key hashing if key is too long
```C++
  if (0x40 < (int)param_4) {
    SHA1Reset(local_80);
    SHA1Input(local_80,param_3,param_4);
    SHA1Result(local_80,(int)local_18);
    param_3 = local_18;
    param_4 = 0x14;
  }
```

`ipad` and `opad` xoring

  do {
    local_c4[iVar1] = local_c4[iVar1] ^ 0x36;
    local_108[iVar1] = local_108[iVar1] ^ 0x5c;
    iVar1 = iVar1 + 1;
  } while (iVar1 < 0x40);

Then another SHA1 pass and we have out signature. This raises only 1 question - what is the key and the payload? Well, this is a simple question of 1 mock reply and 1 breakpoint.

## OpenSession reply 

We already know the fields:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq, TryFromPrimitive, IntoPrimitive)]
#[repr(u8)]
pub enum OpenSessionResponseMADFields {
    //OpenSession
    HMACSignature = 0x1e, //ByteArray
    MassivePlayerID=0x2a, //U32
    MassiveSessionID=0x2b, //U32
    ZoneName=0x47, //String
}
```

All except `HMACSignature` data format is know, so let's steal some more code. Lucky for me, it seems it's 1 to 1 to `String` format. Which is good news.

```C++
...
    uVar1 = ReadU16@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3(param_1_00);
    *param_3 = uVar1;
    if (uVar1 == 0) {
      *param_2 = (void *)0x0;
    }
    else {
      uVar2 = CanRead@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3(param_1_00,(uint)uVar1);
...
```

By constructing a very crude

```rust

#[post("/adsrv/openSession")]
pub async fn open_session_v3(mut req: HttpRequest, mut body: web::Payload) -> impl Responder {
    let hex_string = hex::encode(web::BytesMut::new());
    info!("openSession payload: {hex_string}");

    //We will ignore payload here

    let mut reply = MADReply::new(
        MadServerProtocolVersion::Version3,
        MadReplyTaskId::OpenSession,
    );

    reply.add_bytes(OpenSessionResponseMADFields::HMACSignature, &vec![0; 24]);

    reply.add_u32(OpenSessionResponseMADFields::MassivePlayerID, 1);

    reply.add_u32(OpenSessionResponseMADFields::MassiveSessionID, 1);

    reply.add_string(OpenSessionResponseMADFields::ZoneName, "lobby");

    let bytes = reply.build_reply();

    let hex_string = hex::encode(bytes.clone());
    info!("reply payload: {hex_string}");

    let mut reply = HttpResponse::Ok().body(bytes);

    reply.head_mut().set_camel_case_headers(true);

    reply
}
```

I was able to hit `CalculateSHA1HMac` function in NFS: Carbon

![alt text](img/sha1_step1.png)

Good news: The data that gets hashes is "OpenSession request bytes payload". So this part is rather easy. And key is a string, not raw bytes. So we probably a dealing with some rather simplistic hash from something.

Bad news: The key is not in the payload, which I suspected. And in the decompiler I can see it's location to be unpopulated:

![alt text](img/sha1_key_unpopulated.png)

More snooping, and we find what no Reverse Engineer wants to see.

Something called `MassivePRNG`

## MassivePRNG

`PRGN` or `Pseudo RNG` or Pseudorandom are a pain to work with. Each developer go nuts at the sign of an opportunity to implement "ingenious" anti-tampering feature, and this case is not an exception.

Some cross-reference later and we have a complete function

```C++
void __cdecl MassivePRNG(char *param_1)

{
  int iVar1;
  uint uVar2;
  uint uVar3;
  uint uVar4;
  uint uVar5;
  longlong lVar6;
  char *pcVar7;
  size_t sVar8;
  undefined local_128 [128];
  char local_a8 [128];
  char local_28 [36];
  
  pcVar7 = local_a8;
  sVar8 = 0x80;
  iVar1 = Instance@CMassiveClientCore@MassiveAdClient3();
  lVar6 = GetTime@CMassiveClientCore@MassiveAdClient3(iVar1);
  Instance@CMassiveSystem@MassiveAdClient3();
  GetServerTimeFormatted((uint)lVar6,(uint)((ulonglong)lVar6 >> 0x20),pcVar7,sVar8);
  sVar8 = strlen(local_a8);
  memcpy(local_128,local_a8,sVar8);
  sVar8 = strlen(local_a8);
  init_by_array((int)local_128,(int)sVar8 / 4);
  uVar2 = genrand_int32();
  uVar3 = genrand_int32();
  uVar4 = genrand_int32();
  uVar5 = genrand_int32();
  _snprintf(local_28,0x21,s_%x%x%x%x_009fec18,uVar2,uVar3,uVar4,uVar5);
  strncpy(param_1,local_28,0x21);
  return;
}
```

`GetServerTimeFormatted` is also required to better undestand the flow, so, here

```C++
void GetServerTimeFormatted(uint timestamp,uint seconds,char *return_buffer,size_t param_4)

{
  tm *ptVar1;
  undefined4 extraout_ECX;
  undefined8 uVar2;
  char local_44 [32];
  char local_24 [32];
  
  uVar2 = __aulldvrm(timestamp,seconds,1000,0);
  seconds = (uint)uVar2;
  ptVar1 = localtime((time_t *)&seconds);
  if (ptVar1 == (tm *)0x0) {
    _snprintf(return_buffer,param_4,s_Time_Unavailable_009fe538);
  }
  else {
    _snprintf(local_44,0x20,s_%d-%.2d-%.2d_009fe560,ptVar1->tm_year + 0x76c,ptVar1->tm_mon + 1,
              ptVar1->tm_mday);
    _snprintf(local_24,0x20,s_%.2d:%.2d:%.2d,%.3d_009fe54c,ptVar1->tm_hour,ptVar1->tm_min,
              ptVar1->tm_sec,extraout_ECX);
    _snprintf(return_buffer,param_4,&DAT_009c5fc8,local_44,local_24);
  }
  return;
}
```
This math jumpscare here 

```c++
  uVar2 = __aulldvrm(timestamp,seconds,1000,0);
```

confused me at first, but turns out it's a simple `%` math operation, as confirmed by Xbox 360 decompilation:

```C++
int GetServerTimeFormatted(undefined8 param_1,ulonglong param_2,char *param_3,size_t param_4)

{
  uint *puVar1;
  int iVar2;
  ulonglong local_80 [2];
  char acStack_70 [32];
  char acStack_50 [80];
  
  local_80[0] = param_2 / 1000;
  puVar1 = (uint *)_localtime64(local_80);
  if (puVar1 == (uint *)0x0) {
    iVar2 = _snprintf(param_3,param_4,"Time Unavailable");
  }
  else {
    _snprintf(acStack_50,0x20,"%d-%.2d-%.2d ",(ulonglong)puVar1[5] + 0x76c,(ulonglong)puVar1[4] + 1,
              (ulonglong)puVar1[3]);
    _snprintf(acStack_70,0x20,"%.2d:%.2d:%.2d,%.3d",(ulonglong)puVar1[2],(ulonglong)puVar1[1],
              (ulonglong)*puVar1,param_2 % 1000);
    iVar2 = _snprintf(param_3,param_4,"%s%s",acStack_50,acStack_70);
  }
  return iVar2;
}
```

After a lot of debugging, googling function names and random variables I was able to narrow down the whole flow:

- get timestamp in milliseconds from `locateService` response
- add a number of full seconds that had passed since known timestamp (in NFS: Carbon case for `openSession` it's zero)
- format the timestamp into `2025-01-01 00:00:00,000`
- initialize a `Mersenne Twister PRNG` with 5 u32 from `2025-01-01 00:00:00,000` as byte array (`init_by_array`)
- generate 4 u32 to get the key

Which is fine, give or take. At this moment in time I still have concern regarding `GetTickCount` in the function responsible for the current time, since debuggers could mess this up.

But! It seems like it's only used in `WriteOpenSessionRequest` and `Parse@OpenSessionRequest` which means other messages don't perfrom any signatures checks, and we don't have to worry about it. Hopefully.

So to save us some time I'll just hardcode the value to `1735689600000` which is January 1, 2025 12:00:00 AM. 

### Note for the future.

After some test runs I find out that the string, from which key is generated is adding your local timezone for into parsed time string:

`1735689600000` transforms into `2025-01-01 03:00:00,000` at client side.

This is pose an issue, since client timezone info (at least to my current understandment) is not being send towards the server, and was deducted by the server based on geo ip data. Since 2000s internet transformed sagnificantly and geo ip is not a valid source of info for such calculations. This breaks HMAC signature verification, since server and client can't generate the same key anymore, and breaks the flow entirely.

Lucky for us we can patch it eventually with dll injections, but for now I'll just utilize hardcoded value.

Anyway, onwards, to the next call!

## Back to HMAC

Now we have the key and the payload to generate hmac-sha1 signature.

Finding a rust library, capable of doing this prng properly took a while, but the whole code is rather simple 

```rust
let time = "2025-01-01 03:00:00,000";
    let mut array = bytes_to_vec_u32(time.as_bytes());
    let (left, _) = array.split_at_mut(5);

    let mut mt = MT19937::new_with_slice_seed(left);

    let a = mt19937::MT19937::next_u32(&mut mt);
    let b = mt19937::MT19937::next_u32(&mut mt);
    let c = mt19937::MT19937::next_u32(&mut mt);
    let d = mt19937::MT19937::next_u32(&mut mt);

    let token = format!("{:08x}{:08x}{:08x}{:08x}", a, b, c, d);
```


Now we just need to set a hmac-sha1 combo and we're golden!

## 8 hours later
Update: we're not golden.

As it usually goes, the simplest things turns out the most troublesome. At first, I assumed that signature for a reply is a body of an incoming message, because `CalculateSHA1HMac` was triggered with it as a payload and in `WriteOpenSessionRequest` function there is no mentions of signatures. And since I can check the output of MassiveAdClient HMAC-SHA1 function I can verify if my output is okay or not.

But time and time again I failed to generate the same signature as the one game was generating and at this point you big to loot at each idividual byte and trace all the buffers.

So my breakpoint is set at `CalculateSHA1HMac` and it triggers with `OpenSession` payload.

![alt text](img/open_session_payload.png)

I try to generate an answer to it, push "Run" in x32dbg and... `CalculateSHA1HMac` gets hit again!

But now with my reply payload:

![alt text](img/open_session_reply_payload.png)

What is going on here?

Well turns out game append timestamp and signature to messages after generating the main request payload.

![alt text](img/timestamp_and_sign.png)

And this is up to server to parse and verify it. Which I didn't. And the message signature is based on the message payload with 

**MESSAGE BODY WITHOUT PROTOCOL VERSION BYTE AND WITH SIGNATURE FIELD BYTE (`0x1e`) AT THE END INCLUDED**

*sigh* okay, okay. Those thing happen, you need to be prepared. You would think that after fixing that and adding to my reply builder function the required code with hmac-sha1 of outgoing packet it will finally be working.

And you would be wrong!

For one reason or another HMAC-SHA1 in MassiveAdClient is not compatible with real world implementations and instead is using what looks like a one according to documentations, but all rust and python libs are failing to produce the same result as it.

So I gave up and cheated, by asking ChatGPT to rewrite the source code from the decompiler. Which FINALLY worked.

the final code for the reply with signature looks like:

```rust
    pub fn build_reply_with_signature(self) -> Vec<u8> {

        let mut pre_final_buf: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();

        pre_final_buf.push(self.task_id.into());
        pre_final_buf.write_u32::<BigEndian>(self.buf.len() as u32 + 23); 
        pre_final_buf.extend_from_slice(&self.buf);

        let time = "2025-01-01 03:00:00,000";
        let mut array = bytes_to_vec_u32(time.as_bytes());
        let (left, _) = array.split_at_mut(5);
    
        let mut mt = MT19937::new_with_slice_seed(left);
    
        let a = mt19937::MT19937::next_u32(&mut mt);
        let b = mt19937::MT19937::next_u32(&mut mt);
        let c = mt19937::MT19937::next_u32(&mut mt);
        let d = mt19937::MT19937::next_u32(&mut mt);
    
        let token = format!("{:08x}{:08x}{:08x}{:08x}", a, b, c, d); 
        println!("token = {}", token);
        
        let mut mac = Hmac::<Sha1>::new_from_slice(token.as_bytes()).unwrap();

        let mut temp = pre_final_buf.clone();
        temp.push(0x1e);
  
        let digest = calculate_sha1_hmac_exact(token.as_bytes(), &temp);
        info!("digest: {}", hex::encode(&digest));

        let mut final_buf: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
        final_buf.push(self.version.into());
        final_buf.extend_from_slice(&pre_final_buf);
        final_buf.push(OpenSessionResponseMADFields::HMACSignature as u8);
        final_buf.write_u16::<BigEndian>(digest.len() as u16).unwrap();
        final_buf.extend_from_slice(&digest);

        final_buf
    }
```
And finally, after all of those struggles and shamefull ChatGPT request I was getting

```

And if we break it down:

```
And by analyzing the decompiled code we finally got to the part where game expects assets. But there are some caveats, but let's go step by step.

```

We can see the familiar checks for block id, block lenght and signature checks, which we have already implemented in previous steps. But after it an issue arise in form of 

```C++
...
            if (cVar7 == '%') {
              uVar4 = ?ReadU16@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAGXZ();
              pcVar8 = "IE Count: %d";
              *(short *)(param_1 + 0x60) = (short)uVar4;
LAB_834b71cc:
              uVar4 = uVar4 & 0xffff;
              ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
                        (5,(char)*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0xc),pcVar8,(char)uVar4,param_5,param_6 ,
                         param_7,(char)uVar10);
              goto LAB_834b721c;
            }
            if (cVar7 == 'U') {
              uVar4 = ?ReadU16@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAGXZ();
              *(short *)(param_1 + 0x88) = (short)uVar4;
              pcVar8 = "Order Count: %d";
              goto LAB_834b71cc;
            }
            if (cVar7 == -0x23) {
              iVar5 = ?ReadIEBlock@CRequestEnterZone@MassiveAdClient3@@AAAPAVCMassiveAdObject@2@XZ ()
...
```

What is `IE` ? Well, if we check `ReadIEBlock` we will learn that

```C++
  ?Log@CLog@MassiveAdClient3@@SAXW4__MASSIVE_ENUM_LOG_LEVEL@2@PAD1ZZ
            (5,(char)*(undefined4 *)(param_1 + 0xc),"Reading Inventory Element Block...",param_4,
             (char)param_5,(char)param_6,(char)param_7,(char)param_8);
```

It wasn't very clear to me, what `Inventory Element` is, but a quick google let us know that it stands for `Ad inventory refers to the available ad space on digital platforms like websites, apps, and videos that publishers sell to advertisers to display their advertisements. `. So it seems like we need to let the game know which Inventory Elements exists on the Zone, and this pose a very, very sagnificat challenge for RE. I honestly expected that game would let the backend know about places and sizes of files it wants. But it seems like backend should be already have this data. And I have no idea how to extract this data from NFS: Carbon, let alone any game. Let's put it aside for now and check the rest, because it's more interesting.

Below the `ReadIEBlock` we can see `ReadOrderBlock`

```C++
            else if (cVar7 == -0x1d) {
              iVar5 = ?ReadOrderBlock@CRequestEnterZone@MassiveAdClient3@@AAAPAVCMassiveOrder@2@XZ ()
              ;
```

And inside it we finally get to the juicy part

```C++
        uVar18 = ?ReadU16@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAGXZ(param_1);
        pcVar10 = "Asset Count: %d";
        uVar4 = uVar18 & 0xffff;
```

And if we follow into `ReadAssetBlock`

```C++
        if (cVar8 == -0x22) {
          iVar5 = ?ReadAssetBlock@CRequestEnterZone@MassiveAdClient3@@AAAPAVCMassiveAsset@2@XZ() ;
```

And inside it

```C++
      case 9:
        uVar3 = ?ReadU32@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAIXZ(param_1);
        local_c4 = (undefined4)uVar3;
        pcVar10 = "Asset Type: %d";
        break;
      case 10:
        uVar3 = ?ReadString@CRequestObject@MassiveAdClient3@@IAAPADXZ(param_1);
        uVar18 = uVar3;
        pcVar10 = "Asset URL: %s";
        break;
```

We finally get to the fun part!

And so to sum up all the findings, the `EnterZone` request contain `IE` block and `Order` block, and `Order` block contain `Asset` block which are actual assets, well, urls to assets. I omended some less interesting parts of the `Order` block, but we will get to them, don't you worry.

And now we have a problem in form of unknown `IE` block flow and how are we suppose to get all the placements on the level. But one problem at a time, let's get back to writing the code.And that's were things gets complicated. Game expects 2 arrays in return: campaigns and slots.
